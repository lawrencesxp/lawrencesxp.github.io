                <p>I am a Master's student at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm actively taking up new projects and looking to gain research experience. You can contact me at <a href="lawrencesxp[at]gmail[dot]com. ">lawrencesxp[at]gmail[dot]com</a></p>
                <p> <b>Current role:</b><br>I am a research collaborator @Kyoto University working on renewable energy transition. I used pandas to web-scraped demographics data from census databases with which I analyzed socio-economic status and it’s correlation to energy usage for agricultural labourers.

                    This is part of on-going research program on energy economics on the renewable energy transition and what it means for the socially and economically lower classes in India.
                    
                    This work was presented at the United States Energy Economics Conference held at Chicago in November 2023 under Mr. Soumya Basu with a research grant of ¥300,000</p>

                     <p>ScrapeBoard (WIP):<br>Trying to automate web scraping using a simple pandas script that can scrape any data online (pdf, csv, table format, etc) and be presented online at the users request. <a href="https://lawrencesxp.github.io/scrape_board/">Link</a></p>

                    <li><p>LLM-based Therapeutic Interaction Bot:<br>
                        Created an LLM agent (using Open AI API calls) connected to Unreal Engine to make Human-centric interactions with users. Fine-tuned parameters to make a unique and memory efficient bot that uses NVIDIA’s Audio2Face to animate facial characteristics so it seems like a real Human converstation.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Task Scheduling Implementation:<br>
                        Developed a C++ application to showcase efficient task scheduling in a cloud computing environment using a linear-time rescheduling algorithm based on Prof. Xue Lin’s paper ‘Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment. I have visualized the resulting graphs using pyplot.</li>
