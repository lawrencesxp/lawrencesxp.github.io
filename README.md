## Research Assistant @Kyoto University
I used pandas to web-scraped demographics data from census databases with which I analyzed socio-economic status and it's correlation to energy usage for agricultural labourers.
This is part of on-going research program on energy economics on the renewable energy transition and what it means for the socially and economically lower classes in India.
This work was presented at the United States Energy Economics Conference held at Chicago in November 2023 under Mr. Soumya Basu.
Funding: ¥300,000

## LLM-based Therapeutic Interaction Bot
Created an LLM agent (using Open AI API calls) connected to Unreal Engine to make Human-centric interactions with users. Fine-tuned parameters to make a unique and memory efficient
bot that uses NVIDIA's Audio2Face to animate facial characteristics so it seems like a real Human converstation.

## Task Scheduling Implementation
Developed a C++ application to showcase efficient task scheduling in a cloud computing environment using a linear-time 
rescheduling algorithm based on Prof. Xue Lin’s paper ‘Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud 
Computing Environment’. I have also visualized the resulting graphs using pyplot.
